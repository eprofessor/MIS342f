        <h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            Each student must hand in all the files required for this project to the D2L Assignment Folder &quot;Project 3 Files&quot;.<br />
            But you can work together on this project.
            <br />
            You are strongly encouraged to work on this Project as the semester progresses, do not wait until the last minute.
    <br />
            All Project 3 files, work, evaluations.(see <a href="#deliverables">deliverables</a>)... must be uploaded 
  to the D2L Assignment Folder and handed in by the date and time specified in D2L.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            Project 3 is a  project that combines your 
    knowledge of  Access and business operations.<br />
            You will modify an existing  business 
    database application.
            <br />
            This project illustrates how a typical business can 
    use databases in the operation of a business.
            <br />
            It will also demonstrate just how 
    involved and complicated  database applications can become.
        </p>
        <h3><strong>Details</strong></h3>
        <p>
            1. Decide on a business.   Then you will create a computerized accounting system based on Microsoft Access.<br />
            2. Use the Microsoft Access files yestesta.accdb as a starting point. This file contains the main tables and relationships used in the Business! demo software application.
            <br />
            3. Your group will decide which tables to use from the   file. You can add and delete tables and relationships as appropriate for your   business.<br />
            4. Create queries, forms, reports, macros and modules as listed below for your application.
            <br />
            5. Refer to <a href="DatabaseDesign.htm">this page</a> for   information on database design. Please note there are numerous books and   materials available on this subject. Feel free to use any reference material of   your choosing.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
        <p>1. (50) The application must display a menu upon startup. The menu   must lead the user through the available database objects (tables, queries,   forms, reports...) that are required to run the application. The menu format is   up to your group.</p>
        <p>2. Database object specifications</p>

        <p><strong>Technical Notes-Demo</strong></p>
        <p>
            This project is based on using the Business! demo software.
            <br />
            The <a href="http://www.databasecreations.com">Database Creations</a> website may contain more information.<br />
            You may also want to review the demoguide.pdf file, an older version is in the Project 3 folder.
      <br />
            <br />
            Reviewing this guide will give you an idea of how much work is involved in creating a fully functional financial database application.<br />
