<body>
<p>In the interest of saving class time, I created three  Tegrity recordings that demonstrate how to complete assignment 10 tutorials-10  and 11.<br />
  There is an updated version of Assignment 10 on the course  syllabus that documents how to make visible the MSysObjects and the Switchboard  Manager.<br />
  Ref:  <a href="http://course1.winona.edu/ppaulson/Fall2012/MIS342/Assignments/Assignment10/Assignment10.asp">http://course1.winona.edu/ppaulson/Fall2012/MIS342/Assignments/Assignment10/Assignment10.asp</a> <br />
  You do not have to download a new copy of this file, but you  need to follow the directions at the top to enable view of the MSysObjects and the  Switchboard Manager.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Assignment 10,  Tutorial 10&rdquo;  and &ldquo;Assignment 10,  Tutorial 10, Forms and Reports Switchboards&rdquo;   review how to do Tutorial 10.<br />
  &ldquo;Assignment 10, Tutorial  11-VBA&rdquo; reviews how to write VBA code to enhance your application.</p>
<p>We will not do Assignment 10, Tutorial 12.  <br />
But for purposes of the final make sure you  understand the Database Tools to Analyze Performance, and how you set the  Application Title Property, how to Display a form when the application begins.  These are found in Tutorial 12, step 8 and  11.</p>
<p>Make sure to read Chapter 12.</p>
